# RAG Vector Database Prototype

This repository contains the design blueprint of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system developed for a thesis on vector databases and RAG architectures.

The project focuses on modularity, clarity, and reproducibility.  
It includes source code, documentation, configuration files, and notebooks illustrating the design of the system.

## Repository Structure

- docs/ → Technical documentation  
- src/ → Source code for embeddings, vector stores, and RAG pipeline  
- notebooks/ → Jupyter notebooks (not executed)  
- configs/ → Configuration files  
- data/ → Sample documents  

## Note

Due to resource constraints, the system is not executed locally.  
However, the repository provides a complete and reproducible blueprint for cloud-based deployment.

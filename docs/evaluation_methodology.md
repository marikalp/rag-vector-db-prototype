# Evaluation Methodology

The evaluation focuses on:

- Recall@k
- Latency (theoretical)
- Scalability considerations
- Cost model
- Integration complexity

Due to resource constraints, the system is not executed locally. 
The methodology describes how each metric would be evaluated in a real deployment.
